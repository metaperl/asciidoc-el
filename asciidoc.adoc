asciidoc.el - asciidoc functions for Emacs
==========================================

== Get Started

`M-x asciidoc-get-started` will insert the document header stuff for you.

== Run asciidoc

`M-x asciidoc-compile` will supply you with an editable command line to be 
supplied to the shell. After that you can simply type `M-x recompile` to build 
your document each time.


== Sections

Sections are entered with `asciidoc-section-title`. You enter a
number indicating the number of equals signs you want. And then
you enter the section title.

I'm sorry that I cannot two-line titles. The main reason is that I
think it is much more flexible to just be able to remove an equals
sign to change level rather than try to keep all the various underline
semantics in my head.


== Text Formatting


=== Emphasized text

`M-x asciidoc-emphasized RET You must mop the floor now!` will result
in _You must mop the floor now!_ Which is just what we need in this house.

=== Strong (bold) text
 
`M-x asciidoc-strong RET My name is Hercules` yields *My name is Hercules* and that is strong enough for the best of us.
 
=== Monospaced text

`M-x asciidoc-monospace RET Welcome to nerdville` produces `Welcome to
nerdville` and that is boring enough for the rest of us.

=== Quoted text

`M-x asciidoc-quoted RET Let's get physical` brings us ``Let's get physical'' and who could ask for more?

=== Unquoted text

`M-x asciidoc-unquoted RET who needs this?` yields #who needs this?#

=== Superscripted text

Normal and then `M-x asciidoc-superscript RET super text RET M-x asciidoc-subscript down text RET` yields:

.Result
Normal and then ^super text^ Jules Verne ~under the sea~

=== Copyright, Trademark.

.M-x asciidoc-copyright
(C) Copyright Schemelab Hackers, Inc

.M-x asciidoc-trademark
(TM) Scheme prior to the R6RS mess

.M-x asciidoc-registered-trademark
(R) Registered, signed, sealed, delivered pizza. Delicious.

== Block Actions

[[typical-blockid]]

=== BlockId Element

These are placed just above a block that you want to reference later using the 
`<<blockid,descriptive text>>' convention.

While we are here, we may as well point out `asciidoc-block-reference`, which is 
used to refer to these `BlockIds` that you set up.


== Delimited Blocks

=== Listing block

.M-x asciidoc-listing-block
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(defun fun()
  (progn
    (play in-the-sand)
    (play in-the-band)    
    (play at-the-beach)    
    (play with-the-beets) ; sorry it had to rhyme
   ))
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Literal block

This appears to be best when prefaced with the verse style.

.M-x asciidoc-literal-block

[verse]
..............................................................................
Consul *necessitatibus* per id,
consetetur, eu pro everti postulant
homero verear ea mea, qui.

Qui in magna commodo, est labitur
dolorum an. Est ne *magna primis
adolescens*.
..............................................................................

=== Sidebar Block


.M-x asciidoc-sidebar-block
******************************************************************************
Looks just like a note to me.
But of course it does not have the word ``NOTE'' in front of it... caveat emptor.
******************************************************************************


=== Comment Block

.M-x asciidoc-comment-block
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ignore this text
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


=== Passthrough Blocks

 m-x asciidoc-passthru-* brings them up. I have no use for them.

=== Quotations

Via `M-x asciidoc-quotation-block`

[attribution="Alan Perlis",citetitle="Foreward to Structure and Intepretation of Computer Programs"]
______________________________________________________________________________
Lisp is for building organisms -- imposing, breathtaking, dynamic structures built by squads fitting fluctuating myriads of simpler organisms into place. 
______________________________________________________________________________


You have to manually place 4 periods within your quotation block if you want
a poem or something. The manual shows how to do this.


[attribution="William Blake",citetitle="Auguries of Innocence"]
______________________________________________________________________________
[verse]
....
To see a world in a grain of sand,
And a heaven in a wild flower,
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,
And eternity in an hour.
....
______________________________________________________________________________


=== Example blocks

Most people (myself included) went flying through the Asciidoc manual and 
never took time to see the Example block. We were manually coding such a
best ourself over and over. Well, worry no longer because
`M-x asciidoc-example-block` brings it to your fingertips.

==============================================================================
  2+2

==============================================================================


== Lists

=== Bulleted List

`M-x asciidoc-bullet-item` is the ticket. 

.Shopping List
- Eggs
- Bacon
    * Living
    * Loving
- Snicker's Bar

=== Numbered List

`M-x asciidoc-numbered-list-item` is the ticket. 

. Wake up
. Look at clock
    .. Pray it is still time to sleep
. Realize it's Saturday
. Wake up and hack on favorite projects

[[LL]]
=== Labelled lists

Only vertically labelled lists are supplied here. The horizontal ones look nice,
and you can get them by simply putting the text following the `::` on the same 
line.

`M-x asciidoc-labelled-list-item` will set you free.

Lorem::
    the gypsy was ipsum on the frothy mug

Gypsum::
    the fifth one was just one below the sixth one

== Bibliography Items

`M-x asciidoc-bibliography-item`

+ [[[taoup]]] Eric S. Raymond. 'The art of Unix Programming'. 

== Linkage

=== Hyperlinks

.M-x asciidoc-href

Whenever you want http://www.Perl.com[Perl]
consulting services, be sure to contact http://www.metaperl.com[the best].

==== Relative URLS

.M-x asciidoc-relative-href

Download a link:img/pix/mom/200.jpeg[picture of my mom]
right here!

==== Images

.M-x asciidoc-image-href

image:http://keiapl.info/rhui/kei20040905.jpg["The last photograph of Ken Iverson",link="http://keiapl.info",height=200]


This function only aids in basic usage of Asciidoc's `image` macro. You will 
have to add the `height`, `width`, and `link` attributes yourself if you want 
them. 

=== Internal Document References

You create document anchors with `M-x asciidoc-block-id-element`.
You refer to them using `M-x asciidoc-block-reference`.

Just above "Labelled Lists" above, I created a document anchor `[[LL]]`. Now, 
in the next paragraph I refer to it:

Here is <<LL,Cool J>> at your service.
